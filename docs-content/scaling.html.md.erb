This topic describes how to scale **Altoros Log Search for VMware Tanzu**.

##<a id='determine-if-you-need-to-sclae'></a> Determine if You Need to Scale

Follow the steps below to view a histogram for your recent logs and identify if all logs are being parsed indexed in real-time:

* Select `logs-*` index pattern in the Kibana dashboard.
    <%= image_tag("Images/select-index-pattern.png") %>

* Enter `*` in the Kibana search bar to see all logs.

* Examine the histogram for a gap in recent logs as it is shown on the image below. A gap means that Log Search cannot keep up with indexing and parsing the incoming data in real-time. To address this issue, you can scale up your cluster to handle the load.

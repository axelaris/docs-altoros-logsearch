##<a id='manage-instances'></a> Create, Use, and Manage Service Instances

In order to use the Log Search On Demand Service Broker you should go through the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log into your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
</pre>
1. List the Marketplace services and locate the Logsearch On-Demand Service.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace
	Getting services from marketplace in org example / space development as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	service       		 plans          description
	logsearch-on-demand  single_node  	Logsearch On Demand
</pre>
1. Create an instance of the Logsearch On-Demand Service.
   Currently only single_node service plan is supported.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service logsearch-on-demand single_node YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	Creating service instance YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE in org example / space development as user@example.com...
	OK
</pre>


1. Before binding the app, first check that the service was created.
You can do this by using: `cf service INSTANCE_NAME`.

1. Bind your application to the service instance.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	Binding service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE to app YOUR-APP in org example / space development as user@example.com...
	OK
	TIP: Use 'cf restage YOUR-APP' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

1. Restage the app for the binding to take effect.
   After this step is done Pivotal Platform will start to automatically stream your application logs to the newly created Log Search service instance.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf restage YOUR-APP
</pre>

1. Execute `cf env YOUR-APP` command.
   This step allows you to review environment variables that the Logserach On Demand Broker sets 
for your application. This environment variable has the following format:

    ```
    {
       "syslog_host": <syslog_host>,
       "syslog_port": "5514",
       "kibana_url": <kibana-url>
    }
    ```

1. Use the kibana_url parameter from the previous step to access Kibana UI 
and observe your application logs.

1. Log into Kibana using your platform credentials.
